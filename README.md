<p>Make a call to the following API endpoint: <br>
https://api.rawg.io/api/games?dates=2019-01-01,2019-12-31&ordering=-rating </p>

<p>Loop through the results and display the following properties in HTML, but only for the first eight results:

    name
    rating
    number of tags (not the tag details, just the amount of tags)
</p>

<p>The styling for this assignment is not important but loading indicator should be displayed while the API call is in progress.</p>

<p>Be sure to handle any potential errors in the code.</p>

<p>You can use either regular promise or async/await syntax to make the call.</p>
